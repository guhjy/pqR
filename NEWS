CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-10-21:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This is a minor update to the release of 2014-09-30, with fixes
      for a few problems, and a few performance improvements.  Packages
      installed for pqR-2014-09-30 do not need to be reinstalled for
      this release.

  INSTALLATION, BUILDING, AND TESTING:

    o A new test (var-lookup.R) for correctness of local vs. global
      symbol bindings has been added, which is run with other tests
      done by "make check".

  DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:

    o The documentation on "contexts" in the R Internals manual has
      been updated to reflect a change made in pqR-2014-09-30.  (This
      manual has also been updated to reflect the change below.)

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o Lookup of functions now often skips local environments that were
      previously found not to contain the symbol being looked up.  In
      particular, this speeds up calls of base functions that are not
      already fast due to their being recognized as "special" symbols.

    o The set of "special" symbols for which lookups in local
      environments is usually particularly fast now includes .C,
      .Fortran, .Call, .External, and .Internal.

    o Adjusted a tuning parameter for rowSums and rowMeans to be more
      appropriate for the cache size in modern processors.

  BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed a bug (pqR issue #27) in which a user-defined replacement
      function might get an argument that is not marked as shared,
      which could cause anomalous behaviour in some circumstances.

    o Fixed an issue with passing on variant return requests to
      function bodies (though it's hard to construct an example where
      this issue produces incorrect results).

    o Fixed a bug in initialization of user-supplied random number
      generators, which occassionally showed up in package
      rngwell19937.

    o [ Actually fixed in pqR-2014-09-30 but omitted from NEWS. ] Fixed
      problems with calls of strncpy that were described in PR #15990
      at r-project.org.

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-09-30:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This release contains several major performance improvements.
      Notably, lookup of variables will sometimes be much faster,
      variable updates like v <- v + 1 will often not allocate any new
      space, assignments to parts of variables (eg, a[i] <- 0) is much
      faster in the interpreter (no change for byte-compiled code),
      external functions called with .Call or .External now get faster
      macro or inline versions of functions such as CAR, LENGTH, and
      REAL, and calling of external functions with .C and .Fortran is
      substantially faster, and can sometimes be done in a helper
      thread.

    o Changes have been made to configuration options regarding use of
      BLAS routines for matrix multiplication, as described below.  In
      part, these changes are intended to made the default be close to
      what R Core releases do (but without the unnecessary
      inefficiency).

    o A number of updates from R Core releases after R-2.15.0 have been
      incorporated or adapted for use in pqR.  These provide some
      performance improvements, some new features or feature changes,
      and some bug fixes and documentation updates.

    o Many other feature changes and performance improvements have also
      been made, as described below, and a number of bugs have been
      fixed, some of which are also present in the latest R Core
      release, R-3.1.1.

    o Packages using .Call or .External should be re-installed for use
      with this version of pqR.

  FEATURE CHANGES:

    o The mat_mult_with_BLAS option, which controls whether the BLAS
      routines or pqR's C routines are used for matrix multiplication,
      may now be set to NA, which is equivalent to FALSE, except that
      for multiplication of sufficiently large matrices (not
      vector-vector, vector-matrix, or matrix-vector multiplication)
      pqR will use a BLAS routine unless there is an element in one of
      the operands that is NA or NaN.  This mimics the behaviour of R
      Core implementations (at least through 3.1.1), which is motivated
      by a desire to ensure that NA is propagated correctly even if the
      BLAS does not do so, but avoids the substantial but needless
      inefficiency present in the R Core implementation.

    o A BLAS_in_helpers option now allows run-time control of whether
      BLAS routines may be done in a helper thread. (But this will be
      fixed at FALSE if that is set as the default when pqR is built.)

    o A codePromises option has been added to deparse, and documented
      in help(.deparseOpts).  With this option, the deparsed expression
      uses the code part of a promise, not the value, similarly to the
      existing delayPromises option, but without the extra text that
      that option produces.

    o This new codePromises deparse option is now used when producing
      error messages and traceback output.  This improves error
      messages in the new scheme for subset assignments (see the
      section on performance improvements below), and also avoids the
      voluminous output previously produced in circumstances such as
      the following:
      
         `f<-` <- function (x,value) x[1,1] <- value
         a <- 1
         f(a) <- rep(123,1000)  # gives an error
         traceback()

      This previously produced output with 1000 repetitions of 123 in
      the traceback produced following the error message.  The
      traceback now instead shows the expression rep(123,1000).

    o The evaluate option for dump has been extended to allow access to
      the new codePromises deparse option.  See help(dump).

    o The formal arguments of primitive functions will now be returned
      by formals, as they are shown when printed or with args.  In R
      Core releases (at least to R-3.1.1), the result of formals for a
      primitive is NULL.

    o Setting the deparse.max.lines option will now limit the number of
      lines printed when exiting debug of a function, as well as when
      entering.

    o In .C and .Fortran, arguments may be character strings even when
      DUP=FALSE is specified - they are duplicated regardless.  This
      differs from R Core versions, which (at least through R-3.1.1)
      give an error if an argument is a character string and DUP=FALSE.

    o In .C and .Fortran, scalars (vectors of length one) are
      duplicated (in effect, though not necessarily physically) even
      when DUP=FALSE is specified.  However, they are not duplicated in
      R Core versions (at least through R-3.1.1), so it may be unwise
      to rely on this.

    o A HELPER argument can now be used in .C and .Fortran to specify
      that the C or Fortran routine may (sometimes) be done in a helper
      thread.  (See the section on performance improvements below.)

  FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-3.0.2: The unary + operator now converts a logical vector
      to an integer vector.

    o From R-3.0.0: Support for "converters" for use with .C has been
      dropped.

    o From R-2.15.1: pmin() and pmax()) now also work when one of the
      inputs is of length zero and others are not, returning a
      zero-length vector, analogously to, say, +.

    o From R-2.15.1: .C() gains some protection against the misuse of
      character vector arguments.  (An all too common error is to pass
      character(N), which initializes the elements to "", and then
      attempt to edit the strings in-place, sometimes forgetting to
      terminate them.)

    o From R-2.15.1: Calls to the new function globalVariables() in
      package utils declare that functions and other objects in a
      package should be treated as globally defined, so that CMD check
      will not note them.

    o From R-2.15.1: print(packageDescription(*)) trims the Collate
      field by default.

    o From R-2.15.1: A new option "show.error.locations" has been
      added.  When set to TRUE, error messages will contain the
      location of the most recent call containing source reference
      information. (Other values are supported as well; see ?options.)

    o From R-2.15.1: C entry points R_GetCurrentSrcref and
      R_GetSrcFilename have been added to the API to allow debuggers
      access to the source references on the stack.

  INSTALLATION, BUILDING, TESTING, AND DEBUGGING:

    o The --enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS configuration option has been
      replaced by the ability to use a configure argument of
      mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE, mat_mult_in_BLAS=FALSE, or
      mat_mult_in_BLAS=NA, to set the default value of this option.

    o The --disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers configuration option
      has been replaced by the ability to use a configure argument of
      BLAS_in_helpers=FALSE or BLAS_in_helpers=TRUE to set the default
      value of this option.

    o The LAPACK routines used are now the same as those in R-3.1.1
      (version 3.5.0).  However, the .Call interface to these remains
      as in R-2.15.0 to R-2.15.3 (it was changed to use .Internal in
      R-3.0.0).  Since LAPACK 3.5.0 uses some more recent Fortran
      features, a Fortran 77 compiler such as g77 will no longer
      suffice.

    o Setting the environment variable R_ABORT to any non-null string
      will prevent any attempt to produce a stack trace on a
      segmentation fault, in favour of instead producing (maybe) an
      immediate core dump.

    o The variable R_BIT_BUCKET in share/make/vars.mk now specifies a
      file to receive output that is normally ignored when building
      pqR.  It is set to dev/null in the distribution, but this can be
      changed to help diagnose build problems.

    o The C functions R_inspect and R_inspect3 functions are now
      visible to package code, so they can be used there for debugging.
      To see what they do, look in src/main/inspect.c.  They are
      subject to change, and should not appear in any code released to
      users.

    o The Rf_error and related procedures declared in R_ext/Error.h are
      now if possible declared to never return, allowing for slightly
      better code generation by the compiler, and avoiding spurious
      compiler warnings.  This parallels a change in R-3.0.1, but is
      more general, using the C11 noreturn facility if present, and
      otherwise resorting to the gcc facility (if gcc is used).

  INSTALLATION FEATURES LIKE THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-2.15.1: install.packages("pkg_version.tgz") on Mac OS X
      now has sanity checks that this is actually a binary package (as
      people have tried it with incorrectly named source packages).

    o From R-2.15.2: --with-blas='-framework vecLib' now also works on
      OS X 10.8 and 10.9.

    o From R-2.15.3: Configuration and R CMD javareconf now come up
      with a smaller set of library paths for Java on Oracle-format JDK
      (including OpenJDK).  This helps avoid conflicts between
      libraries (such as libjpeg) supplied in the JDK and system
      libraries.  This can always be overridden if needed: see the 'R
      Installation and Administration' manual.

    o From R-2.15.3: The configure tests for Objective C and Objective
      C++ now work on Mac OS 10.8 with Xcode 4.5.2 (PR#15107).

    o The cairo-based versions of X11() now work with current versions
      of cairographics (e.g. 1.12.10).  (PR#15168)

  DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:

  These are in addition to changes in documentation relating to other
  changes reported here.

    o Some incorrect code has been corrected in the "Writing R
      Extensions" manual, in the "Zero finding" and "Calculating
      numerical derivatives" sections.  The discussion in "Finding and
      Setting Variables" has also been clarified to reflect current
      behaviour.

    o Documentation in the "R Internals" manual has been updated to
      reflect recent changes in pqR regarding symbols and variable
      lookup, and to remove incorrect information about the global
      cache present in the version from R-2.15.0 (and R-3.1.1).

    o Fixed an out-of-date comment in the section on helper threads in
      the "R Internals" manual.

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

  Numerous improvements in speed and memory usage have been made in
  this release of pqR.  Some of these are noted here.

    o Lookup of local variables is now usually much faster (especially
      when the number of local variables is large), since for each
      symbol, the last local binding found is now recorded, usually
      avoiding a linear search through local symbol bindings.  Those
      lookups that are still needed are also now a bit faster, due to
      unrolling of the search loop.

    o Assignments to selected parts of variables (eg, a[i,j] <- 0 or
      names(L$a[[f()]]) <- v) are now much faster in the interpreter.
      (Such assignments within functions that are byte-compiled use a
      different mechanism that has not been changed in this release.)

      This change also alters the error messages produced from such
      assignments.  They are probably not as informative (at least to
      unsophisticated users) as those that the interpreter produced
      previously, though they are better than those produced from
      byte-compiled code.  On the plus side, the error messages are now
      consistent for primitive and user-written replacement functions,
      and some messages now contain short, intelligible expressions
      that could previously contain huge amounts of data (see the
      section on new features above).

      This change also fixes the anomaly that arguments of subset
      expressions would sometimes be evaluated more than once (eg, f()
      in the example above).

    o The speed of .C and .Fortran has been substantially improved,
      partly by incorporating changes in R-2.15.1 and R-2.15.2, but
      with substantial additional improvements as well.

    o The speed of .Call and .External has been improved somewhat.
      More importantly, the C routines called will get macro versions
      of CAR, CDR, CADR, etc., macro versions of TYPEOF and LENGTH, and
      inline function versions of INTEGER, LOGICAL, REAL, COMPLEX, and
      RAW.  This avoidance of procedure call overhead for these
      operations may speed up some C procedures substantially.

    o In some circumstances, a routine called with .C or .Fortran can
      now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other
      computations.  This is done only if requested with the HELPER
      option, and at present only in certain limited circumstances, in
      which only a single output variable is used.  See help(.C) or
      help(.Fortran) for details.

    o As an initial use of the previous feature, the findInterval
      function now will sometimes execute its C routine in a helper
      thread.  (More significant uses of the HELPER option to .C and
      .Fortran will follow in later releases.)

    o Assignments that update a local variable by applying a single
      unary or binary mathematical operation will now often re-use
      space for the variable that is updated, rather than allocating
      new space.  For example, this will be done with all the
      assignments in the second line below:
      
         u <- rep(1,1000); v <- rep(2,1000); w <- exp(2)
         u <- exp(u); u <- 2*u; v <- v/2; u <- u+v; w <- w+1

      This modification also has the effect of increasing the
      possibilities for task merging.  For example, in the above code,
      the first two updates for u will be merged into one computation
      that sets u to 2*exp(u) using a single loop over the vector.

    o The performance of rep and rep.int is much improved.  These
      improvements (and improvements previously made in pqR) go beyond
      those in R Core releases from R-2.15.2 on, so these functions are
      often substantially faster in pqR than in R-2.15.2 or later R
      Core versions to at least R-3.1.1, for both long and short
      vectors.  (However, note that the changes in functionality made
      in R-2.15.2 have not been made in pqR; in particular, pairlists
      are still allowed, as in R-2.15.0.)

    o For numeric vectors, the repetition done by rep and rep.int may
      now be done in a helper thread, in parallel with other
      computations.  For example, attaching names to the result of rep
      (if necessary) may be done in parallel with replication of the
      data part.

    o The amount of space used on the C stack has been reduced, with
      the result that deeper recursion is possible within a given C
      stack limit.  For example, the following is now possible with the
      default stack limit (at least on one Intel Linux system with gcc
      4.6.3, results will vary with platform):
      
         f <- function (n) { if (n>0) 1+f(n-1) else 0 }
         options(expressions=500000)
         f(7000)

      For comparison, with pqR-2014-06-1, and R-3.1.1, trying to
      evaluate f(3100) gives a C stack overflow error (but f(3000)
      works).

    o Expressions now sometimes return constant values, that are
      shared, and likely stored in read-only memory.  These constants
      include NULL, the scalars (vectors of length one) FALSE, TRUE,
      NA, NA_real_, 0.0, 1.0, 0L, 1L, ..., 10L, and some one-element
      pairlists with such constant elements.  Apart from NULL, these
      constants are not _always_ used for the corresponding value, but
      they often are, which saves on memory and associated garbage
      collection time.  External routines that incorrectly modify
      objects without checking that NAMED is zero may now crash when
      passed a read-only constant, which is a generally desirable
      debugging aid, though it might sometimes cause a package that had
      previously at least sort-of worked to no longer run.

    o The substr function has been sped up, and uses less memory,
      especially when a small substring is extracted from a long
      string.  Assignment to substr has also been sped up a bit.

    o The function for unserializing data (eg, reading file .RData) is
      now done with elimination of tail-recursion (on the CDR field)
      when reading pairlists.  This is both faster and less likely to
      produce a stack overflow.  Some other improvements to
      serializing/unserializing have also been made, including support
      for restoring constant values (mentioned above) as constant
      values.

    o Lookup of S3 methods has been sped up, especially when no method
      is found.  This is important for several primitive functions,
      such as $, that look for a method when applied to an object with
      a class attribute, but perform the operation themselves if no
      method is found.

    o Integer plus, minus, and times are now somewhat faster (a side
      effect of switching to a more robust overflow check, as described
      below).

    o Several improvements relating to garbage collection have been
      made.  One change is that the amount of memory used for each
      additional symbol has been reduced from 112 bytes (two CONS
      cells) to 80 bytes (on 64-bit platforms), not counting the space
      for the symbol's name (a minumum of 48 bytes on 64-bit
      platforms).  Another change is in tuning of heap sizes, in order
      to reduce occasions in which garbage collection is very frequent.

    o Many uses of the return statement have been sped up.

    o Functions in the apply family have been sped up when they are
      called with no additional arguments for the function being
      applied.

    o The performance problem reported in PR #15798 at r-project.org
      has been fixed (differently from the R Core fix).

    o A performance bug has been fixed in which any assignment to a
      vector subscripted with a string index caused the entire vector
      to be copied.  For example, the final assignment in the code
      below would copy all of a:
      
         a<-rep(1.1,10000); names(a)[1] <- "x"
         a["x"] <- 9

      This bug exists in R Core implementations though at least
      R-3.1.1.

    o A performance bug has been fixed that involved subscripting with
      many invalid string indexes, reported on r-devel on 2010-07-15
      and 2013-05-8.  It is illustrated by the following code, which
      was more than ten thousand times slower than expected:
      
         x <- c(A=10L, B=20L, C=30L)
         subscript <- c(LETTERS[1:3], sprintf("ID%05d", 1:150000))
         system.time(y1 <- x[subscript])

      The fix in this version of pqR does not solve the related problem
      when assigning to x[subscript], which is still slow.  Fixing that
      would require implementation of a new method, possibly requiring
      more memory.

      This performance bug exists in R Core releases through R-3.1.1,
      but may now be fixed (differently) in the current R Core
      development version.

  BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed a bug in numericDeriv (see also the documentation update
      above), which is illustrated by the following code, which gave
      the wrong derivative:
      
          x <- y <- 10
          numericDeriv(quote(x+y),c("x","y"))

      I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed (differently) in
      R-3.1.1.

    o Fixed a problem in .C and .Fortran where, contrary to the
      documentation (except when DUP=TRUE and no duplication was
      actually needed), logical values after the call other than TRUE,
      FALSE, and NA are not mapped to TRUE, but instead exist as
      invalid values that may show up later.  This bug exists in R Core
      versions 2.15.1 through at least 3.1.1.  I reported it as
      PR#15878 at r-project.org, so it may be fixed in a later R Core
      release.

    o Fixed a problem with treatment of ANYSXP in specifying types of
      registered C or Fortran routines, which in particular had
      prevented the types of str_signif, used in formatC, from being
      registered.  (This bug exists in R Core versions of R at least
      through R-3.1.1.)

    o Fixed a bug in substr applied to a string with UTF-8 encoding,
      which could cause a crash for code such as
      
         a <- "\xc3\xa9"
         Encoding(a) <- "UTF-8"
         b <- paste0(rep(a,8000),collapse="")
         c <- substr(b,1,16000)

      I reported this as PR15910 at r-project.org, so it may be fixed
      in an R Core release after R-3.1.1.  A related bug in assignment
      to substr has also been fixed.

    o Fixed a bug in how debugging is handled that is illustrated by
      the following output:
      
         > g <- function () { A <<- A+1; function (x) x+1 }
         > f <- function () (g())(10)
         > A <- 0; f(); print(A)
         [1] 11
         [1] 1
         > debug(f);
         > A <- 0; f(); print(A)
         debugging in: f()
         debug: (g())(10)
         Browse[2]> c
         exiting from: f()
         [1] 11
         [1] 2

      Note that the final value of A is different (and wrong) when f is
      stepped through in the debugger.  This bug exists in R Core
      releases through at least R-3.1.1.

    o Fixed a bug illustrated by the following code, which gave an
      error saying that p[1,1] has the wrong number of subscripts:
      
         p <- pairlist(1,2,3,4); dim(p) <- c(2,2); p[1,1] <- 9

      This bug exists in R Core releases through at least R-3.1.1.

    o Fixed the following pqR bug (and related bugs), in which b was
      modified by the assignment to a:
      
         a <- list(list(1+1))
         b <- a
         attr(a[[1]][[1]],"fred")<-9
         print(b)

    o Fixed the following bug in which b was modified by an assignment
      to a with a vector subscript:
      
         a <- list(list(mk2(1)))
         b <- a[[1]]
         a[[c(1,1)]][1] <- 3
         print(b)

      This bug also exists in R-2.15.0, but was fixed in R-3.1.1 (quite
      differently than in pqR).

    o Fixed a lack of error checking bug that could cause expressions
      such as match.call(,expression()) to crash from an invalid memory
      reference.  This bug also exists in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.1.

    o Fixed the non-robust checks for integer overflow, which
      reportedly sometimes fail when using clang on a Mac.  This is #PR
      15774 at r-project.org, fixed in R-3.1.1, but fixed differently
      in pqR.

    o Fixed a pqR bug with expressions of the form t(x)%*%y when y is
      an S4 object.

    o Fixed a bug (PR #15399 at r-project.og) in na.omit and na.exclude
      that led to a data frame that should have had zero rows having
      one row instead.  (Also fixed in R-3.1.1, though differently.)

    o Fixed the problem that RStudio crashed whenever a function was
      debugged (with debug).  This was due to pqR having changed the
      order of fields in the RCNTXT structure, which is an internal
      data structure of the interpreter, but is nevertheless accessed
      in RStudio.  The order of fields is now back to what it was.

    o Fixed the bug in nlm reported as PR #15958 at r-project.org,
      along with related bugs in uniroot and optimize.  These all
      involve situations where the function being optimized saves its
      argument in some manner, and then sees the saved value change
      when the optimizer re-uses the space for the argument on the next
      call.  The fix made is to no longer reuse the space, which will
      unfortunately cause a (fairly small) decline in performance.

      The optim function also has this problem, but only when numerical
      derivatives are used.  It has not yet been fixed.  The integrate
      function does not seem to have a problem.

    o Fixed a bug in the code to check for C stack overflow, that may
      show up when the fallback method for determining the start of the
      stack is needed, and a stack check is then done when very little
      stack is in use, resulting in an erroneous report of stack
      overflow.  The problem is platform dependent, but arises on a
      SPARC Solaris system when using gcc 3.4.3, once stack usage is
      reduced by the improvement described above, leading to failure of
      one of the tests for package Matrix.  This bug exists in R Core
      version back to 2.11.1 (or earlier) and up to at least 3.1.1.

  BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-2.15.1: Trying to update (recommended) packages in
      R_HOME/library without write access is now dealt with more
      gracefully.  Further, such package updates may be skipped (with a
      warning), when a newer installed version is already going to be
      used from .libPaths().  (PR#14866)

    o From R-2.15.1: R CMD check with _R_CHECK_NO_RECOMMENDED_ set to a
      true value (as done by the --as-cran option) could issue false
      errors if there was an indirect dependency on a recommended
      package.

    o From R-2.15.1: getMethod(f, sig) produced an incorrect error
      message in some cases when f was not a string).

    o From R-2.15.2: In Windows, the GUI preferences for foreground
      color were not always respected.  (Reported by Benjamin Wells.)

    o From R-2.15.1: The evaluator now keeps track of source references
      outside of functions, e.g. when source() executes a script.

    o From R-2.15.1: The value returned by tools::psnice() for invalid
      pid values was not always NA as documented.

    o From R-2.15.2: sort.list(method = "radix") could give incorrect
      results on certain compilers (seen with clang on Mac OS 10.7 and
      Xcode 4.4.1).

    o From R-3.0.1: Calling file.copy() or dirname() with the invalid
      input "" (which was being used in packages, despite not being a
      file path) could have caused a segfault.

    o From R-3.0.1: dirname("") is now "" rather than "." (unless it
      segfaulted).

    o Similarly to R-3.1.1-patched: In package parallel, child
      processes now call _Exit rather than exit, so that the main
      process is not affected by flushing of input/output buffers in
      the child.

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-06-19:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, documentation
      improvements (including provision of previously missing
      documentation), and changes for compatibility with R Core
      releases.  There are some new features in this release that help
      with testing pqR and packages. There are no significant changes
      in performance.

    o See the sections below on earlier releases for general
      information on pqR.

    o Note that there was a test release of 2014-06-10 that is
      superceded by this release, with no separate listing of the
      changes it contained.

  NEW FEATURES FOR TESTING:

    o The setting of the R_SEED environment variable now specifies what
      random number seed to use when set.seed is not called.  When
      R_SEED is not set, the seed will be set from the time and process
      ID as before.  It is recommended that R_SEED be set before
      running tests on pqR or packages, so that the results will be
      reproducible.  For example, some packages report an error if a
      hypothesis test on simulated data results in a p-value less than
      some threshold.  If R_SEED is not set, these packages will fail
      their tests now and then at random, whereas setting R_SEED will
      result either in consistent success or (less likely) consistent
      failure.

    o The comparison of test output with saved output using Rdiff now
      ignores any output from valgrind, so spurious errors will not be
      triggered by using it.  When using valgrind, the output files
      should be checked manually for valgrind messages that are of
      possible interest.

    o The test script in tests/internet.R no longer looks at CRAN's
      html code, which is subject to change.  It instead looks at a
      special test file at <URL: pqR-project.org>.

    o Fixed problems wit the reg-tests-1b test script.  Also, now sets
      the random seed, so it's consistent (even without R_SEED set),
      and has its output compared to a saved version.  Non-fatal errors
      (with code 5) should be expected on systems without enough memory
      for xz compression.

  CHANGE FOR COMPATIBILITY:

    o The result of diag(list(1,3,5)) is now a matrix of type double.
      In R-2.15.0, this expression did not produce a sensible result.
      A previous fix in pqR made this expression produce a matrix of
      type list.  A later change by R Core also fixed this, but so it
      produced a double matrix, coercing the list to a numeric vector
      (to the extent possible); pqR now does the same.

  DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:

    o The documentation for c now says how the names for the result are
      determined, including previously missing information on the
      use.names argument, and on the role of the names of arguments in
      the call of c.  This documentation is missing in R-2.15.0 and
      R-3.1.0.

    o The documentaton for diag now documents that a diagonal matrix is
      always created with type double or complex, and that the names of
      an extracted diagonal vector are taken from a names attribute (if
      present), if not from the row and column names.  This information
      is absent in the documentation in R-2.15.1 and R-3.1.0.

    o Incorrect information regarding the pointer protection stack was
      removed from help(Memory).  This incorrect information is present
      in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0 as well.

    o There is now information in help(Arithmetic) regarding what
      happens when the operands of an arithmetic operation are NA or
      NaN, including the arbitrary nature of the result when one
      operand is NA and the other is NaN.  There is no discussion of
      this issue in the documentation for R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.

    o The R_HELPERS and R_HELPERS_TRACE environment variables are now
      documented in help("environment variables").  The documentation
      in help(helpers) has also been clarified.

    o The R_DEBUGGER and R_DEBUGGER_ARGS environment variables are now
      documented in help("environment variables") as alternatives to
      the --debugger and --debugger-args arguments.

  BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed lack of protection bugs in the equal and greater functions
      in sort.c.  These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.

    o Fixed lack of protection bugs in the D function in deriv.c.
      These bugs are also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.

    o Fixed argument error-checking bugs in getGraphicsEventEnv and
      setGraphicsEventEnv (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0).

    o Fixed a stack imbalance bug that shows up in the expression
      anyDuplicated(c(1,2,1),incomp=2).  This bug is also present in
      R-2.15.0 and R-3.1.0.  The bug is reported only when the base
      package is not byte compiled (but still exists silently when it
      is compiled).

    o Fixed a bug in the foreign package that showed up on systems
      where the C char type is unsigned, such as a Rasberry Pi running
      Rasbian.  I reported this to R Core, and it is also fixed in
      R-3.1.0.

    o Fixed a lack of protection bug that arose when log produced a
      warning.

    o Fixed a lack of protection bug in the lang[23456] C functions.

    o Fixed a stack imbalance bug that showed up when an assignment was
      made to an array of three or more dimensions using a zero-length
      subscript.

    o Fixed a problem with news() that was due to pqR's version numbers
      being dates (pqR issue #1).

    o Fixed out-of-bound memory accesses in R_chull and scanFrame that
      valgrind reports (but which are likely to be innocuous).

  BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-2.15.1: The string "infinity" now converts correctly to
      Inf (PR#14933).

    o From R-2.15.1: The generic for backsolve is now correct
      (PR#14883).

    o From R-2.15.1: A bug in get_all_vars was fixed (PR#14847).

    o From R-2.15.1: Fixed an argument error checking bug in dev.set.

    o From R-3.1.0-patched: Fixed a problem with mcmapply not
      parallelizing when the number of jobs was less than number of
      cores.  (However, unlike R-3.1.0-patched, this fix doesn't try to
      parallelize when there is only one core.)

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2014-02-23:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This is a maintenance release, with bug fixes, changes for
      compatibility with packages, additional correctness tests, and
      documentation improvements.  There are no new features in this
      release, and no significant changes in performance.

    o See the sections below on earlier releases for general
      information on pqR.

  INSTALLATION AND TESTING:

    o The information in the file "INSTALL" in the main source
      directory has been re-written.  It now contains all the
      information expected to be needed for most installations, without
      the user needing to refer to R-admin, including information on
      the configuration options that have been added for pqR.  It also
      has information on how to build pqR from a development version
      downloaded from github.

    o Additional tests regarding subsetting operations, maintenance of
      NAMEDCNT, and operation of helper threads have been written.
      They are run with make check or make check-all.

    o A "create-configure" shell script is now included, which allows
      for creation of the "configure" shell script when it is
      non-functional or not present (as when building from a
      development version of pqR).  It is not needed for typical
      installs of pqR releases.

    o Some problems with installation on Microsoft Windows (identified
      by Yu Gong) have hopefully been fixed.  (But trying to install
      pqR on Windows is still recommended only for adventurous users.)

    o A problem with installing pqR as a shared library when
      multithreading is disabled has been fixed.

    o Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus C or
      Fortran routines called by .C or .Fortran) that were compiled and
      installed under R Core versions of R must be re-installed for use
      with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions of R
      (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
      packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 or pqR-2013-12-29 with
      this release, because the formats of the crucial internal data
      structures happen not to have changed).

  DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:

    o The instructions in "INSTALL" have been re-written, as noted
      above.

    o The manual on "Writing R Extensions" now has additional
      information (in the section on "Named objects and copying") on
      paying proper attention to NAMED for objects found in lists.

    o More instructions on how to create a release branch of pqR from a
      development branch have been added to mods/README (or MODS).

  CHANGES REGARDING PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY AND CHECKING:

    o Changed the behaviour of $ when dispatching so that the
      unevaluated element name arrives as a string, as in R-2.15.0.
      This behaviour is needed for the "dyn" package.  The issue is
      illustrated by the following code:
      
          a <- list(p=3,q=4)
          class(a) <- "fred"
          `$.fred` <-
            function (x,n) { print(list(n,substitute(n))); x[[n]] }
          print(a$q)

      In R-2.15.0, both elements of the list printed are strings, but
      in pqR-2013-12-29, the element from "substitute" is a symbol.
      Changed help("$") to document this behaviour, and the
      corresponding behaviour of "$<-".  Added a test with make check
      for it.

    o Redefined "fork" to "Rf_fork" so that helper threads can be
      disabled in the child when "fork" is used in packages like
      "multicore".  (Special mods for this had previously been made to
      the "parallel" package, but this is a more universal scheme.)

    o Added an option (currently set) for pqR to ignore incorrect zero
      pointers encountered by the garbage collector (as R-2.15.0 does).
      This avoids crashes with some packages (eg, "birch") that
      incorrectly set up objects with zero pointers.

    o Changed a C procedure name in the "matprod" routines to reduce
      the chance of a name conflict with C code in packages.

    o Made NA_LOGICAL and NA_INTEGER appear as variables (rather than
      constants) in packages, as needed for package "RcppEigen".

    o Made R_CStackStart and R_CStackLimit visible to packages, as
      needed for package "vimcom".

    o Fixed problem with using NAMED in a package that defines
      USE_RINTERNALS, such as "igraph".

    o Calls of external routines with .Call and .External are now
      followed by checks that the routine didn't incorrectly change the
      constant objects sometimes used internally in pqR for TRUE,
      FALSE, and NA.  (Previously, such checks were made only after
      calls of .C and .Fortran.)

  BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
      
          x <- t(5)
          print (x %*% c(3,4))
          print (crossprod(5,c(3,4)))

      The call of crossprod produced an error, whereas the
      corresponding use of %*% does not.

      In pqR-2013-12-29, this bug also affected the expression t(5) %*%
      c(3,4), since it is converted to the equivalent of
      crossprod(5,c(3,4)).

    o Fixed a problem in R_AllocStringBuffer that could result in a
      crash due to an invalid memory access.  (This bug is also present
      in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2.)

    o Fixed a bug in a "matprod" routine sometimes affecting tcrossprod
      (or an equivalent use of %*%) with helper threads.

    o Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
      
          f <- function (a)
          { x <- a
            function () { b <- a; b[2]<-1000; a+b  }
          }
          g <- f(c(7,8,9))
          save.image("tmpimage")
          load("tmpimage")
          print(g())

      where the result printed was 14 2000 18 rather than 14 1008 18.

    o Fixed a bug in prod with an integer vector containing NA, such
      as, prod(NA).

    o Fixed a lack-of-protection bug in mkCharLenCE that showed up in
      checks for packages "cmrutils".

    o Fixed a problem with xtfrm demonstrated by the following:
      
          f<-function(...) xtfrm(...); f(c(1,3,2))

      which produced an error saying '...' was used in an incorrect
      context.  This affected package "lsr".

    o Fixed a bug in maintaining NAMEDCNT when assigning to a variable
      in an environment using $, which showed up in package "plus".

    o Fixed a bug that causes the code below to create a circular data
      structure:
      
          { a <- list(1); a[[1]] <- a; a }

    o Fixed bugs such as that illustrated below:
      
          a <- list(list(list(1)))
          b <- a
          a[[1]][[1]][[1]]<-2
          print(b)

      in which the assignment to a changes b, and added tests for such
      bugs.

    o Fixed a bug where unary minus might improperly reuse its operand
      for the result even when it was logical (eg, in -c(F,T,T,F)).

    o Fixed a bug in pairlist element deletion, and added tests in
      subset.R for such cases.

    o The ISNAN trick (if enabled) is now used only in the interpreter
      itself, not in packages, since the macro implementing it
      evaluates its argument twice, which doesn't work if it has side
      effects (as happens in the "ff" package).

    o Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in task merging being
      disabled when it shouldn't have been.

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-12-29:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This is the first publicized release of pqR after pqR-2013-07-22.
      A verson dated 2013-11-28 was released for testing; it differs
      from this release only in bug and documentation fixes, which are
      not separately detailed in this NEWS file.

    o pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
      improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but
      also by implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See
      the notes below on earlier pqR releases for general discussion of
      pqR, and for information that has not changed from previous
      releases of pqR.

    o The most notable change in this release is that ``task merging''
      is now implemented.  This can speed up sequences of vector
      operations by merging several operations into one, which reduces
      time spent writing and later reading data in memory.  See
      help(merging) and the item below for more details.

    o This release also includes other performance improvements, bug
      fixes, and code cleanups, as detailed below.

  INSTALLATION AND TESTING:

    o Additional configuration options are now present to allow
      enabling and disabling of task merging, and more generally, of
      the deferred evaluation framework needed for both task merging
      and use of helper threads.  By default, these facilities are
      enabled.  The --disable-task-merging option to ./configure
      disables task merging, --disable-helper-threads disables support
      for helper threads (as before), and --disable-deferred-evaluation
      disables both of these features, along with the whole deferred
      evaluation framework.  See the R-admin manual for more details.

    o See the pqR wiki at https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki for
      the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
      work with pqR.

    o Note that any packages (except those written only in R, plus C or
      Fortran routines called by .C or .Fortran) that were compiled and
      installed under R Core versions of R must be re-installed for use
      with pqR, as is generally the case with new versions of R
      (although it so happens that it is not necessary to re-install
      packages installed with pqR-2013-07-22 with this release, because
      the formats of the crucial internal data structures happen not to
      have changed).

    o Additional tests of matrix multiplication (%*%, crossprod, and
      tcrossprod) have been written.  They are run with make check or
      make check-all.

  INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE:

    o The table of built-in function names, C functions implementing
      them, and operation flags, which was previously found in
      src/main/names.c, has been split into multiple tables, located in
      the source files that define such built-in functions (with only a
      few entries still in names.c).  This puts the descriptions of
      these built-in functions next to their definitions, improving
      maintainability, and also reduces the number of global functions.
      This change should have no effects visible to users.

    o The initialization for fast dispatch to some primitive functions
      is now done in names.c, using tables in other source files
      analogous to those described in the point just above.  This is
      cleaner, and eliminates an anomaly in the previous versions of
      pqR that a primitive function could be slower the first time it
      was used than when used later.

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o Some sequences of vector operations can now be merged into a
      single operation, which can speed them up by eliminating memory
      operations to store and fetch intermediate results.  For example,
      when v is a long vector, the expression exp(v+1) can be merged
      into one task, which will compute exp(v[i]+1) for each element,
      i, of v in a single loop.

      Currently, such ``task merging'' is done only for (some)
      operations in which only one operand is a vector. When there are
      helper threads (which might be able to do some operations even
      faster, in parallel) merging is done only when one of the
      operations merged is a simple addition, subtraction, or
      multiplication (with one vector operand and one scalar operand).

      See help(merging) for more details.

    o During all garbage collections, any tasks whose outputs are not
      referenced are now waited for, to allow memory used by their
      outputs to be recovered.  (Such unreferenced outputs should be
      rare in real programs.)  In a full garbage collection, tasks with
      large inputs or outputs that are referenced only as task inputs
      are also waited for, so that the memory they occupy can be
      recovered.

    o The built-in C matrix multiplication routines and those in the
      supplied BLAS have both been sped up, especially those used by
      crossprod and tcrossprod.  This will of course have no effect if
      a different BLAS is used and the mat_mult_with_BLAS option is set
      to TRUE.

    o Matrix multiplications in which one operand can be recognized as
      the result of a transpose operation are now done without actually
      creating the transpose as an intermediate result, thereby
      reducing both computation time and memory usage.  Effectively,
      these uses of the %*% operator are converted to uses of crossprod
      or tcrossprod.  See help("%*%") for details.

    o Speed of ifelse has been improved (though it's now slower when
      the condition is scalar due to the bug fix mentioned below).

    o Inputs to the mod operator can now be piped. (Previously, this
      was inadvertently prevented in some cases.)

    o The speed of the quick check for NA/NaN that can be enabled with
      -DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in CFLAGS has been improved.

  BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed a bug in ifelse with scalar condition but other operands
      with length greater than one.  (Pointed out by Luke Tierney.)

    o Fixed a bug stemming from re-use of operand storage for a result
      (pointed out by Luke Tierney) illustrated by the following:
      
         A <- array(c(1), dim = c(1,1), dimnames = list("a", 1))
         x <- c(a=1)
         A/(pi*x)

    o The --disable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-in-helpers configuration setting
      is now respected for complex matrix multiplication (previously it
      had only disabled use of the BLAS in helper threads for real
      matrix multiplication).

    o The documentation for aperm now says that the default method does
      not copy attributes (other than dimensions and dimnames).
      Previously, it incorrecty said it did (as is the case also in
      R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2).

    o Changed apply from previous versions of pqR to replicate the
      behaviour seen in R-2.15.0 (and later R Core version) when the
      matrix or array has a class attribute.  Documented this behaviour
      (which is somewhat dubious and convoluted) in the help entry for
      apply.  This change fixes a problem seen in package TSA (and
      probably others).

    o Changed rank from prevous versions of pqR to replicate the
      behaviour when it is applied to data frames that is seen in
      R-2.15.0 (and later R Core versions).  Documented this (somewhat
      dubious) behaviour in the help entry for rank.  This change fixes
      a problem in the coin package.

    o Fixed a bug in keeping track of references when assigning
      repeated elements into a list array.

    o Fixed the following bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.2):
      
         v <- c(1,2)
         m <- matrix(c(3,4),1,2)
         print(t(m)%*%v)
         print(crossprod(m,v))

      in which crossprod gave an error rather than produce the answer
      for the corresponding use of %*%.

    o Bypassed a problem with the Xcode gcc compiler for the Mac that
      led to it falsely saying that using -DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in
      CFLAGS doesn't work.

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-07-22:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R Core Team, but
      improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that speed it up, but
      also by implementing some new features and fixing some bugs.  See
      the notes below, on the release of 2013-06-28, for general
      discussion of pqR, and for information on pqR that has not
      changed since that release.

    o This updated release of pqR provides some performance
      enhancements and bug fixes, including some from R Core releases
      after R-2.15.0.  More work is still needed to incorporate
      improvements in R-2.15.1 and later R Core releases into pqR.

    o This release is the same as the briefly-released version of
      2013-17-19, except that it fixes one bug and one reversion of an
      optimization that were introduced in that release, and tweaks the
      Windows Makefiles (which are not yet fully tested).

  FEATURE AND DOCUMENTATION CHANGES:

    o Detailed information on what operations can be done in helper
      threads is now provided by help(helpers).

    o Assignment to parts of a vector via code such as v[[i]]<-value
      and v[ix]<-values now automatically converts raw values to the
      appropriate type for assignment into numeric or string vectors,
      and assignment of numeric or string values into a raw vector now
      results in the raw vector being first converted to the
      corresponding type.  This is consistent with the existing
      behaviour with other types.

    o The allowed values for assignment to an element of an
      "expression" list has been expanded to match the allowed values
      for ordinary lists.  These values (such as function closures)
      could previously occur in expression lists as a result of other
      operations (such as creation with the expression primitive).

    o Operations such as v <- pairlist(1,2,3); v[[-2]] <- NULL now
      raise an error.  These operations were previously documented as
      being illegal, and they are illegal for ordinary lists.  The
      proper way to do this deletion is v <- pairlist(1,2,3); v[-2] <-
      NULL.

    o Raising -Inf to a large value (eg, (-Inf)^(1e16)) no longer
      produces an incomprehensible warning.  As before, the value
      returned is Inf, because (due to their limited-precision
      floating-point representation) all such large numbers are even
      integers.

  FEATURE CHANGES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-2.15.1: On Windows, there are two new environment
      variables which control the defaults for command-line options.

      If R_WIN_INTERNET2 is set to a non-empty value, it is as if
      --internet2 was used.

      If R_MAX_MEM_SIZE is set, it gives the default memory limit if
      --max-mem-size is not specified: invalid values being ignored.

    o From R-2.15.1: The NA warning messages from e.g. pchisq() now
      report the call to the closure and not that of the .Internal.

    o The following included software has been updated to new versions:
      zlib to 1.2.8, LZMA to 5.0.4, and PCRE to 8.33.

  INSTALLATION AND TESTING:

    o See the pqR wiki at https://github.com/radfordneal/pqR/wiki for
      the latest news regarding systems and packages that do or do not
      work with pqR.

    o Note that any previosly-installed packages must be re-installed
      for use with pqR (as is generally the case with new versions of
      R), except for those written purely in R.

    o It is now known that pqR can be successfully installed under Mac
      OS X for use via the command line (at least with some versions of
      OS X).  The gcc 4.2 compiler supplied by Apple with Xcode works
      when helper threads are disabled, but does not have the full
      OpenMP support required for helper threads.  For helper threads
      to work, a C compiler that fully supports OpenMP is needed, such
      as gcc 4.7.3 (available via macports.org).

      The Apple BLAS and LAPACK routines can be used by giving the
      --with-blas='-framework vecLib' and --withlapack options to
      configure.  This speeds up some operations but slows down others.

      The R Mac GUI would need to be recompiled for use with pqR.
      There are problems doing this unless helper threads are disabled
      (see pqR issue #17 for discussion).

      Compiled binary versions of pqR for Mac OS X are not yet being
      supplied.  Installation on a Mac is recommended only for users
      experienced in installation of R from source code.

    o Success has also been reported in installing pqR on a Windows
      system, including with helper threads, but various tweaks were
      required.  Some of these tweaks are incorporated in this release,
      but they are probably not sufficient for installation "out of the
      box".  Attempting to install pqR on Windows is recommended only
      for users who are both experienced and adventurous.

    o Compilation using the -O3 option for gcc is not recommended.  It
      speeds up some operations, but slows down others.  With gcc 4.7.3
      on a 32-bit Intel system running Ubuntu 13.04, compiling with -O3
      causes compiled functions to crash. (This is not a pqR issue,
      since the same thing happens when R-2.15.0 is compiled with -O3).

  INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE:

    o The R internals manual now documents (in Section 1.8) a
      preliminary set of conventions that pqR follows (not yet
      perfectly) regarding when objects may be modified, and how
      NAMEDCNT should be maintained.  R-2.15.0 did not follow any clear
      conventions.

    o The documentation in the R internals manual on how helper threads
      are implemented in pqR now has the correct title.  (It would
      previously have been rather hard to notice.)

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o Some unnecessary duplication of objects has been eliminated.
      Here are three examples: Creation of lists no longer duplicates
      all the elements put in the list, but instead increments NAMEDCNT
      for these elements, so that
      
         a <- numeric(10000)
         k <- list(1,a)

      no longer duplicates a when k is created (though a duplication
      will be needed later if either a or k[[2]] is modified).
      Furthermore, the assignment below to b$x, no longer causes
      duplication of the 10000 elements of y:
      
         a <- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
         b <- a
         b$x <- 2

      Instead, a single vector of 10000 elements is shared between a$y
      and b$y, and will be duplicated later only if necessary.
      Unnecessary duplication of a 10000-element vector is also avoided
      when b[1] is assigned to in the code below:
      
         a <- list (x=1, y=seq(0,1,length=10000))
         b <- a$y
         a$y <- 0
         b[1] <- 1

      The assignment to a$y now reduces NAMEDCNT for the vector bound
      to b, allowing it to be changed without duplication.

    o Assignment to part of a vector using code such as v[101:200]<-0
      will now not actually create a vector of 100 indexes, but will
      instead simply change the elements with indexes 101 to 200
      without creating an index vector.  This optimization has not yet
      been implemented for matrix or array indexing.

    o Assignments to parts of vectors, matrices, and arrays using "["
      has been sped up by detailed code improvements, quite
      substantially in some cases.

    o Subsetting of arrays of three or more dimensions using "[" has
      been sped up by detailed code improvements.

    o Pending summations of one-argument mathematical functions are now
      passed on by sum.  So, for example, in sum(exp(a)) + sum(exp(b)),
      the two summations of exponentials can now potentially be done in
      parallel.

    o A full garbage collection now does not wait for all tasks being
      done by helpers to complete.  Instead, only tasks that are using
      or computing variables that are not otherwise referenced are
      waited for (so that this storage can be reclaimed).

  BUG FIXES:

    o A bug that could have affected the result of sum(abs(v)) when it
      is done by a helper thread has been fixed.

    o A bug that could have allowed as.vector, as.integer, etc.  to
      pass on an object still being computed to a caller not expecting
      such a pending object has been fixed.

    o Some bugs in which production of warnings at inopportune times
      could have caused serious problems have been fixed.

    o The bug illustrated below (pqR issue #13) has been fixed:
      
         > l = list(list(list(1)))
         > l1 = l[[1]]
         > l[[c(1,1,1)]] <- 2
         > l1
         [[1]]
         [[1]][[1]]
         [1] 2

    o Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) illustrated by
      the following code:
      
         > a <- list(x=c(1,2),y=c(3,4))
         > b <- as.pairlist(a)
         > b$x[1] <- 9
         > print(a)
         $x
         [1] 9 2
         
         $y
         [1] 3 4

      The value printed for a has a$x[1] changed to 9, when it should
      still be 1. See pqR issue #14.

    o Fixed a bug (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1) in which
      extending an "expression" by assigning to a new element changes
      it to an ordinary list.  See pqR issue #15.

    o Fixed several bugs (also present in R-2.15.0 and R-3.0.1)
      illustrated by the code below (see pqR issue #16):
      
         v <- c(10,20,30)
         v[[2]] <- NULL        # wrong error message
         
         x <- pairlist(list(1,2))
         x[[c(1,2)]] <- NULL   # wrongly gives an error, referring to misuse
                               # of the internal SET_VECTOR_ELT procedure
         
         v<-list(1)
         v[[quote(abc)]] <- 2  # internal error, this time for SET_STRING_ELT
         
         a <- pairlist(10,20,30,40,50,60)
         dim(a) <- c(2,3)
         dimnames(a) <- list(c("a","b"),c("x","y","z"))
         print(a)              # doesn't print names
         
         a[["a","x"]] <- 0     # crashes with a segmentation fault

  BUG FIXES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE IN LATER R CORE RELEASES:

    o From R-2.15.1: formatC() uses the C entry point str_signif which
      could write beyond the length allocated for the output string.

    o From R-2.15.1: plogis(x, lower = FALSE, log.p = TRUE) no longer
      underflows early for large x (e.g. 800).

    o From R-2.15.1: ?Arithmetic's "1 ^ y and y ^ 0 are 1, _always_"
      now also applies for integer vectors y.

    o From R-2.15.1: X11-based pixmap devices like png(type = "Xlib")
      were trying to set the cursor style, which triggered some
      warnings and hangs.

    o From R-3.0.1 patched: Fixed comment-out bug in BLAS, as per PR
      14964.

CHANGES IN VERSION RELEASED 2013-06-28:

  INTRODUCTION:

    o This release of pqR is based on R-2.15.0, distributed by the R
      Core Team, but improves on it in many ways, mostly ways that
      speed it up, but also by implementing some new features and
      fixing some bugs. One notable speed improvement in pqR is that
      for systems with multiple processors or processor cores, pqR is
      able to do some numeric computations in parallel with other
      operations of the interpreter, and with other numeric
      computations.

    o This is the second publicised release of pqR (the first was on
      2013-06-20, and there were earlier unpublicised releases). It
      fixes one significant pqR bug (that could cause two empty strings
      to not compare as equal, reported by Jon Clayden), fixes a bug
      reported to R Core (PR 15363) that also existed in pqR (see
      below), fixes a bug in deciding when matrix multiplies are best
      done in a helper thread, and fixes some issues preventing pqR
      from being built in some situations (including some partial fixes
      for Windows suggested by "armgong").  Since the rest of the news
      is almost unchanged from the previous release, I have not made a
      separate news section for this release. (New sections will be
      created once new releases have significant differences.)

    o This section documents changes in pqR from R-2.15.0 that are of
      direct interest to users.  For changes from earlier version of R
      to R-2.15.0, see the ONEWS, OONEWS, and OOONEWS files.  Changes
      of little interest to users, such as code cleanups and internal
      details on performance improvements, are documented in the file
      MODS, which relates these changes to branches in the code
      repository at github.com/radfordneal/pqR.

    o Note that for compatibility with R's version system, pqR
      presently uses the same version number, 2.15.0, as the version of
      R on which it is based. This allows checks for feature
      availability to continue to work.  This scheme will likely change
      in the future.  Releases of pqR with the same version number are
      distinguished by release date.

    o See radfordneal.github.io/pqR for current information on pqR,
      including announcements of new releases, a link to the page for
      making and viewing reports of bugs and other issues, and a link
      to the wiki page containing information such as systems on which
      pqR has been tested.

  FEATURE CHANGES:

    o A new primitive function get_rm has been added, which removes a
      variable while returning the value it had when removed.  See
      help(get_rm) for details, and how this can sometimes improve
      efficiency of R functions.

    o An enhanced version of the Rprofmem function for profiling
      allocation of vectors has been implemented, that can display more
      information, and can output to the terminal, allowing the source
      of allocations to more easily be determined.  Also, Rprofmem is
      now always accessible (not requiring the
      --enable-memory-profiling configuration option).  Its overhead
      when not in use is negligible.

      The new version allows records of memory allocation to be output
      to the terminal, where their position relative to other output
      can be informative (this is the default for the new Rprofmemt
      variant).  More identifying information, including type, number
      of elements, and hexadecimal address, can also be output.  For
      more details on these and other changes, see help(Rprofmem).

    o A new primitive function, pnamedcnt, has been added, that prints
      the NAMEDCNT/NAMED count for an R object, which is helpful in
      tracking when objects will have to be duplicated.  For details,
      see help(pnamedcnt).

    o The tracemem function is defunct.  What exactly it was supposed
      to do in R-2.15.0 was unclear, and optimizations in pqR make it
      even less clear what it should do.  The bit in object headers
      that was used to implement it has been put to a better use in
      pqR.  The --enable-memory-profiling configuration option used to
      enable it no longer exists.

      The retracemem function remains for compatibility (doing
      nothing).  The Rprofmemt and pnamedcnt functions described above
      provide alternative ways of gaining insight into memory
      allocation behaviour.

    o Some options that can be set by arguments to the R command can
      now also be set with environment variables, specifically, the
      values of R_DEBUGGER, R_DEBUGGER_ARGS, and R_HELPERS give the
      default when --debugger, --debugger-args, and --helpers are not
      specified on the command line.  This feature is useful when using
      a shell file or Makefile that contains R commands that one would
      rather not have to modify.

  INSTALLATION AND TESTING:

    o The procedure for compiling and installing from source is largely
      unchanged from R-2.15.0.  In particular, the final result is a
      program called "R", not "pqR", though of course you can provide a
      link to it called "pqR".  Note that (as for R-2.15.0) it is not
      necessary to do an "install" after "make" - one can just run
      bin/R in the directory where you did "make".  This may be
      convenient if you wish to try out pqR along with your current
      version of R.

    o Testing of pqR has so far been done only on Linux/Unix systems,
      not on Windows or Mac systems.  There is no specific reason to
      believe that it will not work on Windows or Mac systems, but
      until tests have been done, trying to use it on these systems is
      not recommended.  (However, some users have reported that pqR can
      be built on Mac systems, as long as a C compiler fully supporting
      OpenMP is used, or the --disable-helper-threads configuration
      option is used.)

    o This release contains the versions of the standard and
      recommended packages that were released with R-2.15.0.  Newer
      versions may or may not be compatible (same as for R-2.15.0).

    o It is intended that this release will be fully compatible with
      R-2.15.0, but you will need to recompile any packages (other that
      those with only R code) that you had installed for R-2.15.0, and
      any other C code you use with R, since the format of internal
      data structures has changed (see below).

    o New configuration options relating to helper threads and to
      matrix multiplication now exist.  For details, see
      doc/R-admin.html (or R-admin.pdf), or run ./configure --help.

      In particular, the --disable-helper-threads option to configure
      will remove support for helper threads.  Use of this option is
      advised if you know that multiple processors or processor cores
      will not be available, or if you know that the C compiler used
      does not support OpenMP 3.0 or 3.1 (which is used in the
      implementation of the helpers package).

    o Including -DENABLE_ISNAN_TRICK in CFLAGS will speed up checks for
      NA and NaN on machines on which it works.  It works on Intel
      processors (verified both empirically and by consulting Intel
      documentation).  It does not work on SPARC machines.

    o The --enable-memory-profiling option to configure no longer
      exists.  In pqR, the Rprofmem function is always enabled, and the
      tracemem function is defunct.  (See discussion above.)

    o When installing from source, the output of configure now displays
      whether standard and recommended packages will be byte compiled.

    o The tests of random number generation run with make check-all now
      set the random number seed explicitly.  Previously, the random
      number seed was set from the time and process ID, with the result
      that these tests would occasionally fail non-deterministically,
      when by chance one of the p-values obtained was below the
      threshold used.  (Any such failure should now occur consistently,
      rather than appearing to be due to a non-deterministic bug.)

    o Note that (as in R-2.15.0) the output of make check-all for the
      boot package includes many warning messages regarding a
      non-integer argument, and when byte compilation is enabled, these
      messages identify the wrong function call as the source.  This
      appears to have no wider implications, and can be ignored.

    o Testing of the "xz" compression method is now done with try, so
      that failure will be tolerated on machines that don't have enough
      memory for these tests.

    o The details of how valgrind is used have changed. See the source
      file memory.c.

  INTERNAL STRUCTURES AND APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE:

    o The internal structure of an object has changed, in ways that
      should be compatible with R-2.15.0, but which do require
      re-compilation.  The flags in the object header for DEBUG, RSTEP,
      and TRACE now exist only for non-vector objects, which is
      sufficient for their present use (now that tracemem is defunct).

    o The sizes of objects have changed in some cases (though not
      most).  For a 32-bit configuration, the size of a cons cell
      increases from 28 bytes to 32 bytes; for a 64-bit configuration,
      the size of a cons cell remains at 56 bytes.  For a 32-bit
      configuration, the size of a vector of one double remains at 32
      bytes; for a 64-bit configuration (with 8-byte alignment), the
      size of a vector of one double remains at 48 bytes.

    o Note that the actual amount of memory occupied by an object
      depends on the set of node classes defined (which may be tuned).
      There is no longer a separate node class for cons cells and
      zero-length vectors (as in R-2.15.0) - instead, cons cells share
      a node class with whatever vectors also fit in that node class.

    o The old two-bit NAMED field of an object is now a three-bit
      NAMEDCNT field, to allow for a better attempt at reference
      counting.  Versions of the the NAMED and SET_NAMED macros are
      still defined for compatibility.  See the R-ints manual for
      details.

    o Setting the length of a vector to something less than its
      allocated length using SETLENGTH is deprecated.  The LENGTH field
      is used for memory allocation tracking by the garbage collector
      (as is also the case in R-2.15.0), so setting it to the wrong
      value may cause problems.  (Setting the length to more than the
      allocated length is of course even worse.)

  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

    o Many detailed improvements have been made that reduce general
      interpretive overhead and speed up particular functions.  Only
      some of these improvements are noted below.

    o Numerical computations can now be performed in parallel with each
      other and with interpretation of R code, by using ``helper
      threads'', on machines with multiple processors or multiple
      processor cores.  When the output of one such computation is used
      as the input to another computation, these computations can often
      be done in parallel, with the output of one task being
      ``pipelined'' to the other task.  Note that these parallel
      execution facilities do not require any changes to user code -
      only that helper threads be enabled with the --helpers option to
      the command starting pqR. See help(helpers) for details.

      However, helper threads are not used for operations that are done
      within the interpreter for byte-compiled code or that are done in
      primitive functions invoked by the byte-code interpreter.

      This facility is still undergoing rapid development.  Additional
      documentation on which operations may be done in parallel will be
      forthcoming.

    o A better attempt at counting how many "names" an object has is
      now made, which reduces how often objects are duplicated
      unnecessarily.  This change is ongoing, with further improvements
      and documentation forthcoming.

    o Several primitive functions that can generate integer sequences -
      ":", seq.int, seq_len, and seq_along - will now sometimes not
      generate an actual sequence, but rather just a description of its
      start and end points.  This is not visible to users, but is used
      to speed up several operations.

      In particular, "for" loops such as for (i in 1:1000000) ...  are
      now done without actually allocating a vector to hold the
      sequence.  This saves both space and time.  Also, a subscript
      such as 101:200 for a vector or as the first subscript for a
      matrix is now (often) handled without actually creating a vector
      of indexes, saving both time and space.

      However, the above performance improvements are not effective in
      compiled code.

    o Matrix multiplications with the %*% operator are now much faster
      when the operation is a vector dot product, a vector-matrix
      product, a matrix-vector product, or more generally when the sum
      of the numbers of rows and columns in the result is not much less
      than their product.  This improvement results from the
      elimination of a costly check for NA/NaN elements in the operands
      before doing the multiply.  There is no need for this check if
      the supplied BLAS is used.  If a BLAS that does not properly
      handle NaN is supplied, the %*% operator will still handle NaN
      properly if the new library of matrix multiply routines is used
      for %*% instead of the BLAS.  See the next two items for more
      relevant details.

    o A new library of matrix multiply routines is provided, which is
      guaranteed to handle NA/NaN correctly, and which supports
      pipelined computation with helper threads.  Whether this library
      or the BLAS routines are used for %*% is controlled by the
      mat_mult_with_BLAS option. The default is to not use the BLAS,
      but the --enable-mat-mult-with-BLAS-by-default configuration
      option will change this.  See help("%*%") for details.

    o The BLAS routines supplied with R were modified to improve the
      performance of the routines DGEMM (matrix-matrix multiply) and
      DGEMV (matrix-vector multiply).  Also, proper propagation of NaN,
      Inf, etc. is now always done in these routines.  This speeds up
      the %*% operator in R, when the supplied BLAS is used for matrix
      multiplications, and speeds up other matrix operations that call
      these BLAS routines, if the BLAS used is the one supplied.

    o The low-level routines for generation of uniform random numbers
      have been improved.  (These routines are also used for
      higher-level functions such as rnorm.)

      The previous code copied the seed back and forth to .Random.seed
      for every call of a random number generation function, which is
      rather time consuming given that for the default generator
      .Random.seed is 625 integers long.  It also allocated new space
      for .Random.seed every time.  Now, .Random.seed is used without
      copying, except when the generator is user-supplied.

      The previous code had imposed an unnecessary limit on the length
      of a seed for a user-supplied random number generator, which has
      now been removed.

    o The any and all primitives have been substantially sped up for
      large vectors.

      Also, expressions such as all(v>0) and any(is.na(v)), where v is
      a real vector, avoid computing and storing a logical vector,
      instead computing the result of any or all without this
      intermediate, looking at only as much of v as is needed to
      determine the result.  However, this improvement is not effective
      in compiled code.

    o When sum is applied to many mathematical functions of one vector
      argument, for example sum(log(v)), the sum is performed as the
      function is computed, without a vector being allocated to hold
      the function values.  However, this improvement is not effective
      in compiled code.

    o The handling of power operations has been improved (primarily for
      powers of reals, but slightly affecting powers of integers too).
      In particular, scalar powers of 2, 1, 0, and -1, are handled
      specially to avoid general power operations in these cases.

    o Extending lists and character vectors by assigning to an index
      past the end, and deleting list items by assigning NULL have been
      sped up substantially.

    o The speed of the transpose (t) function has been improved, when
      applied to real, integer, and logical matrices.

    o The cbind and rbind functions have been greatly sped up for large
      objects.

    o The c and unlist functions have been sped up by a bit in simple
      cases, and by a lot in some situations involving names.

    o The matrix function has been greatly sped up, in many cases.

    o Extraction of subsets of vectors or matrices (eg, v[100:200] or
      M[1:100,101:110]) has been sped up substantially.

    o Logical operations and relational operators have been sped up in
      simple cases. Relational operators have also been substantially
      sped up for long vectors.

    o Access via the $ operator to lists, pairlists, and environments
      has been sped up.

    o Existing code for handling special cases of "[" in which there is
      only one scalar index was replaced by cleaner code that handles
      more cases.  The old code handled only integer and real vectors,
      and only positive indexes.  The new code handles all atomic
      vectors (logical, integer, real, complex, raw, and string), and
      positive or negative indexes that are not out of bounds.

    o Many unary and binary primitive functions are now usually called
      using a faster internal interface that does not allocate nodes
      for a pairlist of evaluated arguments. This change substantially
      speeds up some programs.

    o Lookup of some builtin/special function symbols (eg, "+" and
      "if") has been sped up by allowing fast bypass of non-global
      environments that do not contain (and have never contained) one
      of these symbols.

    o Some binary and unary arithmetic operations have been sped up by,
      when possible, using the space holding one of the operands to
      hold the result, rather than allocating new space.  Though
      primarily a speed improvement, for very long vectors avoiding
      this allocation could avoid running out of space.

    o Some speedup has been obtained by using new internal C functions
      for performing exact or partial string matches in the
      interpreter.

  BUG FIXES:

    o The "debug" facility has been fixed.  Its behaviour for if,
      while, repeat, and for statements when the inner statement was or
      was not one with curly brackets had made no sense.  The fixed
      behaviour is now documented in help(debug).  (I reported this bug
      and how to fix it to the R Core Team in July 2012, but the bug is
      still present in R-3.0.1, released May 2013.)

    o Fixed a bug in sum, where overflow is allowed (and not detected)
      where overflow can actually be avoided.  For example:
      
         > v<-c(3L,1000000000L:1010000000L,-(1000000000L:1010000000L))
         > sum(v)
         [1] 4629

      Also fixed a related bug in mean, applied to an integer vector,
      which would arise only on a system where a long double is no
      bigger than a double.

    o Fixed diag so that it returns a matrix when passed a list of
      elements to put on the diagonal.

    o Fixed a bug that could lead to mis-identification of the
      direction of stack growth on a non-Windows system, causing stack
      overflow to not be detected, and a segmentation fault to occur.
      (I also reported this bug and how to fix it to the R Core Team,
      who included a fix in R-2.15.2.)

    o Fixed a bug where, for example, log(base=4) returned the natural
      log of 4, rather than signalling an error.

    o The documentation on what MARGIN arguments are allowed for apply
      has been clarified, and checks for validity added.  The call
      
         > apply(array(1:24,c(2,3,4)),-3,sum)

      now produces correct results (the same as when MARGIN is 1:2).

    o Fixed a bug in which Im(matrix(complex(0),3,4)) returned a matrix
      of zero elements rather than a matrix of NA elements.

    o Fixed a bug where more than six warning messages at startup would
      overwrite random memory, causing garbage output and perhaps
      arbitrarily bizarre behaviour.

    o Fixed a bug where LC_PAPER was not correctly set at startup.

    o Fixed gc.time, which was producing grossly incorrect values for
      user and system time.

    o Now check for bad arguments for .rowSums, .colSums, .rowMeans,
      and .rowMeans (would previously segfault if n*p too big).

    o Fixed a bug where excess warning messages may be produced on
      conversion to RAW.  For instance:
      
         > as.raw(1e40)
         [1] 00
         Warning messages:
         1: NAs introduced by coercion 
         2: out-of-range values treated as 0 in coercion to raw 

      Now, only the second warning message is produced.

    o A bug has been fixed in which rbind would not handle non-vector
      objects such as function closures, whereas cbind did handle them,
      and both were documented to do so.

    o Fixed a bug in numeric_deriv in stats/src/nls.c, where it was not
      duplicating when it should, as illustrated below:
      
         > x <- 5; y <- 2; f <- function (y) x
         > numericDeriv(f(y),"y")
          [1] 5
          attr(,"gradient")
               [,1]
          [1,]    0
          > x
          [1] 5
          attr(,"gradient")
               [,1]
          [1,]    0

    o Fixed a bug in vapply illustrated by the following:
      
         X<-list(456)
         f<-function(a)X
         A<-list(1,2)  
         B<-vapply(A,f,list(0))
         print(B)
         X[[1]][1]<-444
         print(B)

      After the fix, the values in B are no long changed by the
      assignment to X. Similar bugs in mapply, eapply, and rapply have
      also been fixed.  I reported these bugs to r-devel, and
      (different) fixes are in R-3.0.0 and later versions.

    o Fixed a but in rep.int illustrated by the following:
      
         a<-list(1,2)
         b<-rep.int(a,c(2,2))
         b[[1]][1]<-9
         print(a[[1]])

    o Fixed a bug in mget, illustrated by the following code:
      
         a <- numeric(1)
         x <- mget("a",as.environment(1))
         print(x)
         a[1] <- 9
         print(x)

    o Fixed bugs that the R Core Team fixed (differently) for R-2.15.3,
      illustrated by the following:
      
         a <- list(c(1,2),c(3,4))
         b <- list(1,2,3)
         b[2:3] <- a
         b[[2]][2] <- 99
         print(a[[1]][2])
      
         a <- list(1+1,1+1)
         b <- list(1,1,1,1)
         b[1:4] <- a
         b[[1]][1] <- 1
         print(b[2:4])

    o Fixed a bug illustrated by the following:
      
         > library(compiler)
         > foo <- function(x,y) UseMethod("foo")
         > foo.numeric <- function(x,y) "numeric"
         > foo.default <- function(x,y) "default"
         > testi <- function () foo(x=NULL,2)
         > testc <- cmpfun (function () foo(x=NULL,2))
         > testi() 
         [1] "default"
         > testc()
         [1] "numeric"

    o Fixed several bugs that produced wrong results such as the
      following:
      
         a<-list(c(1,2),c(3,4),c(5,6))
         b<-a[2:3]
         a[[2]][2]<-9
         print(b[[1]][2])

      I reported this to r-devel, and a (different) fix is in R-3.0.0
      and later versions.

    o Fixed bugs reported on r-devel by Justin Talbot, Jan 2013 (also
      fixed, differently, in R-2.15.3), illustrated by the following:
      
         a <- list(1)
         b <- (a[[1]] <- a)
         print(b)
         a <- list(x=1)
         b <- (a$x <- a)
         print(b)

    o Fixed svd so that it will not return a list with NULL elements.
      This matches the behaviour of La.svd.

    o Fixed (by a kludge, not a proper fix) a bug in the "tre" package
      for regular expression matching (eg, in sub), which shows up when
      WCHAR_MAX doesn't fit in an "int".  The kludge reduces WCHAR_MAX
      to fit, but really the "int" variables ought to be bigger.  (This
      problem showed up on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.)

    o Fixed a minor error-reporting bug with (1:2):integer(0) and
      similar expressions.

    o Fixed a small error-reporting bug with "$", illustrated by the
      following output:
      
          > options(warnPartialMatchDollar=TRUE)
          > pl <- pairlist(abc=1,def=2)
          > pl$ab
          [1] 1
          Warning message:
          In pl$ab : partial match of 'ab' to ''

    o Fixed documentation error in R-admin regarding the
      --disable-byte-compiled-packages configuration option, and
      changed the DESCRIPTION file for the recommended mgcv package to
      respect this option.

    o Fixed a bug reported to R Core (PR 15363, 2013-006-26) that also
      existed in pqR-2013-06-20.  This bug sometimes caused memory
      expansion when many complex assignments or removals were done in
      the global environment.
